# **Code-Classes**

Welcome to my coding space!  
This repository contains projects, exercises, and learning notes across multiple programming languages as I grow as a developer.

---

## 📚 **Languages in This Repository**

This repo includes code from:

- **Python**
- **JavaScript**
- **HTML/CSS**
- **C/C++**
- **R**
- *(More languages may be added as I learn them.)*

Each folder is organized by language and topic to keep everything clean and easy to follow.

## 📌 **What You’ll Find Here**

### 🔹 **Core Programming Concepts**
Examples that demonstrate:
- Variables & data types  
- Conditional logic (`if`, `else if`, `else`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Functions & modular programming  
- Data structures like lists, arrays, dictionaries, and objects  

### 🔹 **Projects & Exercises**
Smaller programs and practice tasks that show how I apply concepts in real projects.

### 🔹 **File Handling**
Reading/writing files across languages  
(e.g., Python `open()`, C file streams, JavaScript file APIs).

### 🔹 **Using Libraries & Frameworks**
Examples include:
- **Python:** Pandas, Requests  
- **JavaScript:** DOM scripting and basic APIs  
- **C/C++:** Standard library-based examples

## 🚀 **In Progress / Coming Soon**

- Object-Oriented Programming (multiple languages)  
- Small applications and utilities  
- Beginner data analysis projects  
- Web development basics  
- GUI experiments and simple APIs
