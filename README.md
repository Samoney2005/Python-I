# Python-I

Welcome to my Python code!  
As I learn and grow as a developer, I'm using this space to document my progress and showcase the skills I'm acquiring.  
This repository contains various code snippets and programs that demonstrate my understanding of core Python concepts and libraries.

## ðŸ“Œ Core Concepts

This repository contains examples of my work with the following concepts:

### ðŸ”¹ Variables and Data Types
Code that demonstrates how to declare variables and work with various data types, such as **strings, integers, floats, and booleans**.

### ðŸ”¹ Control Flow
Examples of using **conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to make decisions and **loops** (`for`, `while`) to repeat actions in my programs.

### ðŸ”¹ Functions
Code that shows how to define and call **functions** to organize code into reusable blocks, improving readability and efficiency.

### ðŸ”¹ Data Structures
Programs that utilize and manipulate fundamental data structures like **lists, dictionaries, and tuples** to store and manage data.

### ðŸ”¹ File I/O
Simple scripts that demonstrate **reading from and writing to files**, allowing my programs to handle persistent data.

### ðŸ”¹ External Libraries
Code that shows how to install and use external libraries like **Pandas** for data analysis and **Requests** for interacting with web pages.

## ðŸš€ What's Next

I am currently working on expanding my skills in **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and building more complex applications.  
Future work will likely involve creating a more interactive **graphical user interface (GUI)** or developing a simple **API**.
